# Multilingual Text Classification notebook

## Overview

This repository contains a notebook dedicated to **text classification**, specifically focused on **language detection**. The notebook utilizes various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to build a model capable of detecting the language of a given text. The model has been trained using a dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The model was trained using the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/basilb2s/language-detection

This dataset contains a collection of 10K text samples written in 17 different languages, providing the necessary data for training and evaluating the language detection model.

## Trained models
