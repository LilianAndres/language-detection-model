# Text Language Classification 🌍

An academic project to **classify the language of a given text** using Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and other handy libraries. Perfect for learning text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classical machine learning! 🚀

## Features ✨
- Text preprocessing with regex and tokenization
- Feature extraction using `CountVectorizer`
- Classification with **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- Evaluation with accuracy score and confusion matrix
- Visualization of results with Matplotlib

## How it Works 🧩
1. Text preprocessing: Clean text using regex and remove unwanted characters.
2. Feature extraction: Convert text into numerical vectors with CountVectorizer.
3. Model training: Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the training set.
4. Evaluation: Check predictions on the test set with accuracy and visualizations.

This pipeline is simple, interpretable, and turned out being very effective for language classification tasks.
